Close callbacks

Call stack ‚Äî‚Äî> libv API ‚Äî‚Äî> Event Queue ‚Äî‚Äî> Event loop ‚Äî‚Äî> Call stack

Firstly checks for timers and processes it, after that processes callbacks, after that idle, prepare phase comes in this phase it check if any background task can be done it event loop is available. After that comes poll phase in this phase it check if any incoming request are there, after that it check event queue, at last it closes callbacks if any callback need to be closed.
